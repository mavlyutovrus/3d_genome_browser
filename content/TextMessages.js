'CHiP-Seq mode' : ['You are in the CHiP-Seq mode.<br>You can point to the particular part of genome, left click and observe DNA sequences on the same strand in space that are affected by the proteins.<br>According to the level of affect, DNA sequences are highlighted in red-green scale, where red is responsible for a strong affection level, and green is oppositely responsible for weak one. Later by pointing and/or clicking the colored area you can find out transcription factors and other details.<br><b>Attention, if you change the mode you will loose all colored regions.</b><br>This mode is very difficult both for processing and visualization.' ]}
