'CHiP-Seq mode' : ['<h3>You are in the <b>CHiP-Seq mode</b>.</h3>All Transcription Factors from ChIP-Seq experiments that are available for this cubic area have been already shown. Colored parts are the proteins that affect parts of genome sequence. According to the level of protein-DNA interaction, green corresponds to the low level(~0) and red one - to the high one(~1000).
